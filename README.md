This is my first project.The objective of this project is to develop an Inventory Management System for RAHAT SuperStore using Java. The system will efficiently manage product information, including adding, displaying, searching, updating, deleting, and selling products. It will utilize serialization and deserialization techniques to handle product data efficiently.

Includes details such as code, name, rate, quantity, weight, and description to aid store managers in understanding the inventory.
3.Search Product:

Enhances user experience by allowing them to search for specific products using their codes.
Displays detailed information about the product if found.
4.Delete Product:

Streamlines the process of removing products from the superstore.
Deletes a product record based on the provided code, maintaining the accuracy of the inventory.
5.Update Product:

Facilitates the modification of product information.
Users can update details such as name, rate, quantity, weight, and description to ensure the database reflects accurate product information.
6.Sale Product:

Simulates the sale process, allowing users to input product codes and quantities to update the inventory.
Provides a practical representation of the product selling workflow.
